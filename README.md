# Description

Exploring fireworks animation on a 128x64 black/white screen.
It works but not great. It takes up too much space to be useful as a "reward"
animation at the end of a game.

I am suspending further development for now.

# Running

On Linux, with the [SDL2 library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) installed,
the game can be compiled with 
```
  cd Desktop
  make
```
Then run `./ardusdl`.
